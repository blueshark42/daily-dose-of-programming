# Path To Treasure
Difficulty: Easy

## Part 1
You are on a beach and a few people come up to you to help them. Somehow they felt the super smart brain in you. Anyway, they found a paper with a list of numbers that are 
apparently coordinates. You do not have to worry about how the coordinates work, they are just asking you to find the 2 numbers that add up to `2021`.

Your goal is to find the 2 numbers that add up to `2021`, then multiply them.

Your Input:
```
1722
979
366
299
676
1456
```
One of these combinations add up to `2021`. The 2 numbers that add up need to be multiplied. Your result should be: `514878`

## Part 2
You and your team go to the location with high hopes to find some gold.. or something. You start digging and you hit on something hard. It's a chest!
It's so heavy it requires 4 people to lift it. You manage to lift it out on the shore and open it. This sucks. It's just a bunch of rocks and another piece of paper.

The paper says: 
- *We want to make sure we get the ones that deserve it to the end. Not some impostor followers. The location of the final treasure can be found on the
coordinates of the 3 numbers that add up to 2021, and then are multiplied. Good Luck.*

Your goal is to find the 3 numbers that add up to `2021`, then multiply them.

Your input remains the same.
Your expected output: `242220264`
