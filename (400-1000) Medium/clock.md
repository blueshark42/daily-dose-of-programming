# Clock

Problem Rating: 500 (Medium)

## Part 1

You are working at an office where weird things are happening and your clock broke. Therefore your task is to create a working clock that
counts from X to Y in a time span of Z minutes. 

For example, `clock(2, 1)` should count from `0:00` to `2:00` in 1 minute.

- Your goal is to create the working clock

**Input:**

- Call to the function in your code.

```c
clock(6, 3.5);
```

**Expected Output:** A clock ticking from 0:00 -> 6:00 in a time span of 3.5 mins.

**Note:** You can assume inputs are always valid although it is a nice extra challenge if you fix edge cases such as these :)
