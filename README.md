# Daily Dose of Programming

Just have a few programming problems for you to solve to improve your skills :)
The problems are intentionally easier than some real world problems, but you quickly get to the level of real problems.

Feel free to solve them in any order you want. For those that want some kind of rating system you can use the one below.

## Ranking System

Currently there are 5 divisions: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard and Master.

### Problems & Divisions

In order to grade your skills, each problem is rated. The higher the rating, the more difficult the problem is.
Each problem is divided into 2 parts. The first problem is the main problem while the second problem is a harder version of the problem.
To get the problem score you only have to solve first part. How this all works is further explained under in **Solving the Problems -> Problem Parts**

Only condition here is that to complete part 2, you need to complete part 1 beforehand.

If you solve a problem, you receive the rating that problem had. If that rating is higher than any previous rating you had, it becomes your new rating.
To pass a division you have to solve at least 3/4 of all the problems in the division. After that you have to solve the finale for that division.

### Finales

To get access to the next division you have to complete the finale designated for your current highest division.
If you solve the problem you officially passed your division and you can attempt the harder problems.

## Solving the Problems

These things might change, but most probably and usually the problems will have the following form:

- Difficulty, rating, restrictions (language, time, memory, etc.)
- Short description or prompt describing the problem
- **Input:** The input you should expect to receive. This might be data types or boundaries, etc.
- **Output:** The output you should output to pass the test.
- **Your Input:** The input your program has to pass into the solution.
- **Expected Output:** The expected output of your program, these values must equal in order to pass unless stated otherwise.
- **Note:** Further help, notes or explanations of the problem.

### Problem Parts

Each problem is divided into 2 parts:

- **Part 1:** The main part. You are awarded the problem rating points for completing it.
- **Part 2:** A harder version of the question. These are not rated but you can complete them if you feel like it.

## Ranked
Rankeds are problem sets that are completed at the same time by all contestants. They get a limited amount of time to complete and submit as much solutions as possible.
