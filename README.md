## Challenge Difficulties
- b - Beginner, those with little to no experience with programming
- e - Easy, those with little experience with coding
- m - Medium, a bit harder than easy but doesn't require a lot more skills
- h - Hard, requires good progamming skills, while coming up with clever solutions

## What to expect with programming?
Programming is just giving your computer instructions through some kind of programming language which then will be either interpreted or compiled into instructions
that the computer can understand.

### Programming Languages
It takes quite a while to learn, but eventually when you learn it, it becomes easier. It is like riding a bike or driving a car. You can learn to drive a ferrari and be perfect
with it, then you change to a lambo and it feels a bit odd but with a few hours in it you would feel comfortable with it as well.

The hard part is that you will have to learn to think differently, you will have to think outside the box. But for the languages theres a lot of them. Each good for different
things. Here are some common ones and their uses:

- **C** - Embedded systems, kernels, really close to hardware. Let's you do most of the work, and is crazy fast.
- **C++** - Slightly easier and has more things than C. It's like C on steroids. Used for systems, games and programs as it's fast and efficient.
- **C#** - C-Sharp is Microsoft's programming language. It is like a modernised and easier C++. It does garbage collection and other things for you. Used for Windows development.
- **JavaScript** - Used for web front-end development. Syntax similiar to the C languages.
- **Python** - Data science, AI mainly. Really easy to write but very slow compared to C or C++.

The 3 languages every programmer should know in my opinion is: ASM, C/C++ and Python. 
- ASM really low level so you really get to know what actually happens when you run some code,
- C/C++ teaches you low level programming, these languages won't hold your hand and help you. They are tough but when you learn them, you will have a ton of power in your hands,
- Python is nice because you can do a lot of things, it's simple so it let's your brain think more about the problem rather than the way to program it.

## How to learn and improve
Watching "How to learn XYZ in ABC minutes" won't teach you a lot. The best way of learning is to write and read code. Just as learning to drive or ride a bike.
It will take a while and a lot of effort. 
- If you decide to work on something, choose something over your comfort zone. Something a bit difficult but not super difficult that you'd get stuck on it for ages.

## How to become a XYZ
People might write a basic program or something just a little more sophisticated and ask how to become a hacker or say they are some godlike developer. In reality hackers are
just people that solve problems in a clever way. It's not something you learn like mathemathics or chemistry, it comes with skill as you learn. Again just as with cars.
You don't learn to drive fast and not die, it comes with skill. 
- Skilled programmers can write clean, efficient and optimized code. Networking knowledge is also a good skill to have, as you will understand things outside of just your
local computer and learn how computers communicate. At a young age only the truly skilled and determined will have such skills.
