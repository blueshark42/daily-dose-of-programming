# Second Place (3pt)

You will receive `n` arrays, `a`, which will contain `i` elements. These arrays will contain integers. You will have to print the second largest element in the array.

For example, in the array `[3, 6, 4, 2]` the second largest element is `4`. Therefore you will print the number `4`.

If there is only one element present in the array, print that element.

**Input:**

- The first input contains `n, 1 <= n <= 10^3` - the number of test cases.
- The second input contains `i, 1 <= r <= 10^6` - the number of elements in the array.
- Each following input will contain `e, -10^3 <= e <= 10^3` - the element in the array.

**Output:**

- Print the second largest value in the array.

**Your Input:**

```
3
3
3 1 2
4
0 1 2 3
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**

```
2
2
0
```

**Note:** Make sure you read the inputs properly in this problem.
