# Counting Students

Problem B from Fundamentals Round #1

## Part 1

Your school needs some statistics of how many girls and boys are in each class. You got chosen to count the amount of girls and boys in your class. Of course we are not doing it the lame way.

Each boy has a value of `7` while each girl has a value of `5`. You have to count and print the amount of girls and boys in the class.
**Input:**

- The first input contains `n, 1 <= n <= 35` - the amount of students in the class.
- The following inputs contain either the number `7`or `5`.

**Output:**

- Print the amount of girls and boys in the class separated by a space or new line.

**Your Input:**

```
20
7 7 5 7 5 5 5 7 5 7 7 5 7 5 5 7 7 7 5 5
```

**Expected Output:**

```
10 10
```

**Note:**

The answer is `10 10`, because the class has 10 girls and 10 boys.
